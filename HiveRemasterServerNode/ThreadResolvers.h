            For each client socket (the amount of maximum connections), check if they are equal to 0. In case they are, it means they are empty (the logic behind the code)
            After that, accept function returns FD in case connection is accepted which results that FD is bigger than zero.
            Then we have pipe write process to pass the new client info
            finally, we add newly created client to the list

            In case that client is initialized and accepted (client socket in this case returns number bigger than 0, it means connection already exists, and we can implement mechanism for heartbeat.
            Heartbeat can also be implemented in another header, which will have separate while(1), because accept() is a blocking function or it can be used with timeout (maybe better solution for more readability)
            Heartbeat is required in order to clear client sockets that are no longer being used, the ones that are disconnected or lost connection, so new clients can join/rejoin

            Checking of accept can also be implemented by using Select
